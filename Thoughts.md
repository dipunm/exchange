- Typescript would be useful to ensure types are properly formed across the codebase.
- Grape may not be the best p2p library -- with only a "send to one random node" and a "send to all nodes" method.
- Sending to specific clients can be done by registering service names with unique ids.
- Public network requires MORE validation and DoS protection etc.
- Prevent memory leak: expire orders except for on original client and auto-refresh
- chosen cli tool crashes when terminal is resized
- TODO: Make clients sync when starting up.
- No security included, it is likely possible to spoof a user or their orders... That said, the implementation of the order itself would probably dictate how to secure it best.
